RAILS REFACTOR
--------------
Basic renames and refactorings for rails projects.
Although these are not perfect, they'll do a lot of the work for you 
and save you time. 
Before using, recommend that you start from a clean repository state so 
you can easily review changes.

Put rails_refactor.rb on your PATH (it is in the lib directory).
Change directory to the root of your rails project.

To rename a controller:
  $ rails_refactor.rb rename OldController NewController 

* renames controller file & class name in file
* renames controller spec file & class name in file
* renames view directory
* renames helper file & module name in file
* updates routes

To rename a controller action:
  $ rails_refactor.rb rename DummyController.old_action new_action

* renames controller action in controller class file
* renames view files for all formats

To rename a model:
  $ rails_refactor.rb rename OldModel NewModel

* renames model file & class name in file
* renames spec file & class name in file
* renames migration & class name & table names in file

To run tests, move to 'dummy' rails project directory:
  $ ../lib/rails_refactor.rb test

More refactorings coming soon... Please fork and contribute :-)
